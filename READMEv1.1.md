Version 1.1 Changelog:

1. Fixed issue with "Compose" text in the button extending out of the button border at high zoom levels.

2. Fixed issue with char counter getting stuck at chars remaining when the text field clears after submitting a tweet (before it would still work as intended, but it would display the chars remaining of the submitted tweet until the user began to type in the field again).

3. Various minor styling changes.

4. Added feature: users can now "like" tweets by clicking on the heart icon.
